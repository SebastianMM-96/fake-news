# Application site in Flask :rocket:

The environment developed for the Tantei application was made in Flask as a first measure, 
although it is also intended to be done using one of the following technologies:

* React,
* Angular,
* Vue

## Using the flask environment

To access the environment and start it use the following command:

```
$> .\applicationSite\Scripts\activate
```

Once the above command is done, the next thing is to run the command: ``` $> python app.py ``` to start the application on port 3200.

## Updates

The information of the environment will change as progress is made.
