# Data Analysis

We will perform the data analysis for each of the data sets, to verify which of all the data sets is most useful to perform the model.

## [EDA Datacamp Dataset](https://github.com/SebastianMM-96/fake-news/tree/main/data_analysis/EDA)

This data analysis is performed on the data set that can be obtained at the following [link]("https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/fake_or_real_news.csv"). 

For those who want to help continue or just see this project, I leave the tag.
