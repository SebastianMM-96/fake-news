# Script test file :rocket:

The purpose of this python notebook is to get to test the models that are generated.
The notebook is very simple, we only need to load the classification model and within an input field we enter the body of the news. 
The classification is in charge of making the prediction and this same one will return a value between 0 and 1. 

```
0 : { Fake news }
```

```
1 : { Real news }
```
